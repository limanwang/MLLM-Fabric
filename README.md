## 📄 Overview

This is the official repository for the paper:

> **MLLM-Fabric: Multimodal Large Language Model-Driven Robotic Framework for Fabric Sorting and Selection**  
> Accepted to **IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)**

MLLM-Fabric is a novel framework that combines the power of **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)** with robotic systems to perform **fabric sorting and selection** in real-world scenarios. This project aims to bridge the gap between high-level language understanding and low-level robotic manipulation in complex environments.
